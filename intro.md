# Introduction

I'm Kevin Meredith. Since August-2013 I've worked professionally in Scala.

Beginning in Feb-2017, I joined a company to write code in Scala in a pure functional programming way. During that time-frame,
I have built and maintained in production at least six http4s web services. In addition, have maintained, at least five
other web services. During this time, I've used cats, scalaz, scalaz-concurrent, doobie, cats-effect, fs2, circe, argonaut,
refined, scalacheck, specs2 and scalatest libraries when building these production-deployed web services.

Prior to my current pure FP in Scala job, I have built web services using Jersey, Play, Lift, Hibernate, Akka and Spring.

Born and raised in Pennsylvania, I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering from Villanova University.
Next, I earned my Masters of Engineering in Networking from University of Pennsylvania while working full time.

In 2017 I spoke at NEScala, [Property-based Testing with ScalaCheck by Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xUGBreqpnA).
In2020, I gave a talk at NEScala, []1000+ Compile-time Errors Later and Running Smoothly in Prod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXQJChR2ii0&t=5s).

I work remotely in Miami, FL.

## Intended Audience

My intended audience is intermediate software developers, namely those with some experience in functional programming.

## Why I'm Writing This Book

With pure FP in Scala, especially using http4s, I have the most confidence that my code does what I've intended for it to
do. In other words, pure FP in Scala is a powerful tool for enhancing the programmer's ability to reason about his/her
code. That, I firmly believe, is a significant competitive advantage in business.

http4s's [docs](https://http4s.org/v0.21/) have helped me to use its library.

In this book, I will give my opinions, based on my real-world production experience, on how I've gotten the most
value out of pure FP and http4s.

[Referential Transparency](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/3zofjl/why_is_future_totally_unusable/cyns21h/) and
types, especially effectful ones, are the reason.
